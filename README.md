### <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"> Hello, I'm [Giuseppe Mele](https://www.giuseppemele.com/)!

I am a self-taught developer with UI/UX design skills working with front-end & backend-end technologies. I´m based in Phoenix, AZ and currently seeking a full time position as a front-end or junior full-stack developer.


### What tools do I use? 👨‍💻

Currently my go-to is React & Redux on the front-end, Node.js & Express.js for back-end, and MongoDB or PostgreSQL for database. 

### What are my goals? 😃🧾

**Goal #1** is to never get bored and never stop learning. **Goal #2** is to work alongside people with a growth mindset. **Goal #3** is to be a well rounded full-stack developer within the next 2 years.

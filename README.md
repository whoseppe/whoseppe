I am a self-taught developer with UI/UX design skills working with front-end & backend-end technologies.

### What tools do I use? 👨‍💻

Currently, my go-to is React & React Native on the front-end. I also have professional experience with Laravel, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB and SQL. 

### What are my goals? 😃🧾

**Goal #1** is to never get bored and never stop learning. **Goal #2** is to work alongside people with a growth mindset. **Goal #3** is to be a well rounded full-stack developer. 

P.S.
